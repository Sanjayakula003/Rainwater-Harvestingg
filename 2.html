             <p>The philosophy of prevention always being better than cure rings true for rainwater harvesting systems and here at Rain Catcher we encourage commissioning of any system, along with continuous annual / biannual maintenance, whether that rainwater harvesting system is a new or old one.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
<p>Taking out a maintenance and service contract with us will keep you updated with regular pictorial and written reports notifying you of any wear and tear issues, tank cleaning requirements, new regulatory improvements and any other ways you can better the efficiency of your harvesting system.</p>
